# Bugs:
- Centering board don`t work pixel perfect
- Tail animation when snake eat food
- Pause info remains after game reset
- Snake direction can be changed after Game Over, cause problmes after game restart
- THICK borders cause animation stuttering

# Ideas:
- To complete level you have to collect some amount of food. Last food can be displayed in different color. In later levels some timer can be added and then fruits should be collected within time, else level is lost.
- GUI: displaying current level, collected food, and food remained to next level.
